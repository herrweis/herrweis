            <p>Outlining a framework for governing digital design across the entire organisation, the strategy included steps to socialize the practice, educate teams, and promote design-led thinking at all levels. It also focused on creating clear career paths and ladders while fostering a strong design community. My plan emphasized collaboration, innovation, and consistency, transforming how the organisation approached digital experiences.</p>

            <p>Within just a year, the new Digital Design Practice proved highly successful and began to scale. Through design experiments and effective stakeholder management, the practice fostered a deeper understanding of the importance of design across the organisation. The team&apos;s work broke down silos between divisions, simplifying complex user needs and business requirements into clear, usable product prototypes. This approach enhanced communication, collaboration, and reinforced the value of a professional design mindset, with design-led thinking becoming increasingly integrated across the organisation.</p>
