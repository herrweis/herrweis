        I live for the challenge of making digital experiences not just usable but exceptional, both visually and functionally. I thrive on finding that sweet spot where design meets accessibility and usabilityâ€”without sacrificing a single pixel of visual quality.

        Over the years, Iâ€™ve been building and transforming design teams, creating cultures that thrive on collaboration, diversity, and a bit of disruption. Iâ€™m often the spanner in the worksâ€”the one who isnâ€™t afraid to shake things up when things get too comfortable. Iâ€™ve built design practices from the ground up, shaped digital brands, and thrown myself into just about every aspect of design you can imagine. I bring that start-up mentality where it fits because the best solutions often come from a little disruption. And while Iâ€™m sometimes still hands-on when it comes to design, I also know when to step back and let my team shine.

        Diversity and accessibility arenâ€™t just buzzwords for me; theyâ€™re non-negotiables. Iâ€™m all about creating products that everyone can use, understand, and enjoyâ€”and building truly diverse teams to make that happen. Iâ€™m not afraid to bring in designers who donâ€™t fit the conventional mold but will create something truly exceptional and unexpected. Whether it means meticulously refining micro-interactions or blowing up a design system that just doesnâ€™t fit, I believe that the best outcomes come from a mix of perspectives and skills.
